# TODO

- [ ] Get a canvas animating something
  - [ ] update rust state on tick
  - [ ] update canvas based on state

Existing update/render example: https://github.com/tuzz/game-loop/blob/master/src/helper.rs#L22-L51
A discussion with some links https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-can-i-make-game-loop-with-rust-to-wasm/29873/5
Gameloop library: https://github.com/tuzz/game-loop/blob/master/examples/using_wasm/src/main.rs


- [ ] Get livereload working with wasm
- [ ] Decide on whether to use canvas, webGL or webGPU
  - [ ] Probably canvas - the others are likely to be too great a distraction

- [ ] JS files complain about no tsserver/no prettier install.
