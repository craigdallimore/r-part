# TODO

- [ ] Get a canvas animating something
  - [ ] update rust state on tick
  - [ ] update canvas based on state



- [ ] Get livereload working with wasm
- [ ] Decide on whether to use canvas, webGL or webGPU
  - [ ] Probably canvas - the others are likely to be too great a distraction

- [ ] JS files complain about no tsserver/no prettier install.
